                    Hi, I am Madeleine Brighouse, take a look at a little part of my brain if you dare. Welcome to my craziness!
                    <br/>
                    The reason for taking Photographs to me is the capturing of moments you wish to keep or share. I experience way too many interesting things not to share them somewhere, from Music to Fashion, Art, People, Projects and things I just love. I dislike having to use the written word. So here are my thoughts, experiences and ideas through images.
                    <br/>   
                    All photos were taken by me unless otherwise said.
                    <br/>
                    Right then that's me.
                    <br/>
                    Enjoy 
                    <br/>
                    Oh And Shoes! I love shoes, especially Dr Martens!
